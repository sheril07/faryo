Faryo is a lightweight phone and desktop workbench for the same live
`tmux`-backed Codex CLI, Claude Code, or shell session.

Use it to check output, send one instruction, approve or interrupt an agent,
attach context, and return to the same desktop terminal. It is not remote
desktop, a hosted IDE, a browser terminal, or a second AI chat history.

Read the launch note:
[`Faryo: mobile workbench for tmux-backed Codex and Claude sessions`](docs/launch/faryo-1.0.0.md).

## Use It For

- check a long-running terminal AI task from a phone
- send a short follow-up without opening a raw terminal
- approve, interrupt, attach files, or hand off notes
- keep phone and desktop on the same `tmux` session history

Best-supported path:

```text
Linux endpoint
  + tmux
  + Codex CLI
  + Chrome / Android Chrome PWA
```

macOS Owner packaging, iOS Safari, Claude Code session discovery, and generic
shell TUIs are supported but less polished.

## Quickstart

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/Snailflyer/faryo/releases/download/v1.0.0/faryo_1.0.0_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i faryo_1.0.0_all.deb
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now faryo-owner-keepalive.timer
mkdir -p ~/.faryo/owner/config
cp /opt/faryo/apps/owner/config/faryo.env.example ~/.faryo/owner/config/faryo.env
$EDITOR ~/.faryo/owner/config/faryo.env
curl --noproxy '*' http://127.0.0.1:8765/health
```

- [Troubleshooting & Deployment Verification](docs/launch/faryo-1.0.0.md#troubleshooting--deployment-verification)

Owner should bind to `127.0.0.1`. Public access should go through Gateway, which
injects Owner tokens server-side so browsers do not receive raw Owner tokens.

## How It Works

Faryo has two small components:

```text
phone / desktop browser
  -> Faryo Gateway
  -> Owner endpoint
  -> tmux session
  -> Codex, Claude, or shell TUI
```

`apps/gateway` is the public workbench. It owns login, route authorization,
endpoint health, session selection, handoff packages, and proxying to Owner
endpoints. Owner tokens are injected server-side and are not exposed to the
browser.

`apps/owner` is the local execution surface. It binds to loopback, controls a
target `tmux` pane, captures terminal output, sends text, uploads attachments to
a configured inbox, and discovers resumable Codex/Claude history.

The browser UI stays thin. It renders the workbench, sends commands, uploads
attachments, and switches sessions; it does not replace the terminal runtime.

The endpoint package intentionally includes only Owner. Gateway is source
deployed because it is the public routing and policy layer.

## Endpoint Fit

Faryo is built around a lightweight browser workbench, but endpoints and
browsers do not behave identically.

The most refined path today is:

```text
Linux endpoint
  + tmux
  + Codex CLI
  + Chrome / Android Chrome PWA
```

That path has received the most tuning for mobile viewport behavior, PWA use,
compact output, command input, attachment handling, session switching, and
Codex history convergence.

Supported but less heavily polished paths:

- macOS Owner packaging through the launchd installer.
- iOS Safari as a browser surface.
- Claude Code session discovery and compact rendering.
- Generic shell TUIs controlled through tmux capture/send.

These paths are usable, but they may need additional refinement around browser
viewport behavior, backgrounding, paste/input edge cases, compact rendering, and
agent-specific session history mapping.

## Agent Convergence

Faryo treats "session convergence" as the process of making four things line up:

```text
active tmux session
  + visible terminal process
  + agent history record
  + workbench session card
```

Different agents expose different state, so Faryo uses different convergence
rules.

Codex is the most mature integration:

- reads the Codex local session database
- filters internal and subagent branches from normal history
- maps the active tmux process back to the current Codex thread
- resumes sessions through `codex resume`
- applies Codex-specific compact output rules

Claude is supported with a different path:

- reads Claude project JSONL history
- tracks managed Claude tmux sessions with Faryo tmux metadata
- resumes sessions through Claude session IDs
- applies Claude-specific compact output rules

Claude convergence is intentionally separate from Codex convergence. It is not
as heavily tuned yet, especially across macOS, iOS Safari, and less common
Claude output states.

Generic shell sessions are controlled through tmux only. They can be captured,
viewed, and sent input, but they do not have Codex/Claude-style semantic history
convergence.

## UI Interaction Model

Faryo's UI is a workbench, not a document editor or chat clone. The main screen
is optimized for repeated mobile checks and short control actions. Screenshots
near the top are redacted examples.

Core interactions:

- Workbench first: Gateway opens to route status, active sessions, recent
  history, and pending handoff packages.
- Session cards: each card represents a resumable agent session or active tmux
  session. Opening a card routes the browser to that endpoint and session.
- Compact output: the default mobile view reduces noisy terminal output into
  readable work blocks while keeping the session grounded in terminal history.
- Raw output: full terminal capture is available when exact terminal evidence is
  needed.
- Latest control: when the user scrolls up, Faryo does not force-jump the view;
  new output waits until the user taps the latest control.
- Composer: the bottom input sends text into the active tmux pane. It works well
  with mobile keyboards and system dictation.
- Attachments: images and files can be uploaded into the configured inbox and
  referenced in the active session.
- Handoff packages: prompts, notes, screenshots, and files can be picked up and
  injected into a selected session.
- Agent controls: interrupt, approve, page up/down, resume, and close actions
  are exposed as direct controls instead of hidden terminal shortcuts.
- Thin state: the browser remembers display preferences, but the work session
  itself remains in tmux and the agent history store.

The UI intentionally avoids heavyweight panels and IDE-style layout. It should
feel fast enough to open, inspect, dictate a command, attach context, and leave.

## Core Features

- Mobile-first PWA workbench with compact and raw terminal views.
- Shared session history across phone and desktop through the same `tmux`
  session.
- Codex and Claude session discovery, resume, interrupt, and approval controls.
- Multi-endpoint routing for local machines and cloud endpoints.
- Handoff packages for prompts, notes, images, and files.
- Lightweight attachment handling with local inbox paths.
- No browser automation, no remote desktop stack, and no database server in the
  runtime path.

## Runtime State

Source code lives in this repository. Runtime configuration and secrets do not.

```text
~/.faryo/
  gateway/
    config/faryo.env
    config/gateway-auth.json
    state/
    logs/
  owner/
    config/faryo.env
    data/
```

Example configuration files live under:

```text
apps/gateway/config/faryo.env.example
apps/owner/config/faryo.env.example
```

## Requirements

Owner endpoint:

- Python 3.11 or newer
- `tmux`
- `curl`
- `zsh`
- optional: `git`, `openssh-client`, Codex CLI, Claude Code

Gateway:

- Python 3.11 or newer
- `bcrypt`
- a reverse proxy such as Caddy or nginx for public HTTPS

## Packaging

Endpoint releases are built from `apps/owner/RELEASE`.

```bash
scripts/package-client.sh check
scripts/package-client.sh release
```

The release target builds:

```text
dist/faryo_<version>_all.deb
dist/faryo_<version>_macos.tar.gz
dist/SHA256SUMS
```

Install the Linux endpoint package on an Owner machine:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i dist/faryo_<version>_all.deb
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now faryo-owner-keepalive.timer
```

After configuration, the Owner health and status endpoints should answer on
loopback. `releaseVersion` in `/api/status` is the endpoint version to use for
upgrade acceptance.

## Repository Layout

```text

apps/owner/         Local tmux-backed execution endpoint
packages/shared/    Shared code and contracts as they are extracted

```

## Security Model

Faryo is designed for a trusted operator running their own endpoints.

- Owner should bind only to `127.0.0.1`.
- Public access should go through Gateway.
- Tokens, password hashes, cookie secrets, and runtime env files are private
  runtime state.
- File preview and attachment APIs are token-protected and constrained by
  supported file types.
- Gateway bridge URL attachments reject private, loopback, link-local,
  multicast, reserved, and unresolved hosts.
